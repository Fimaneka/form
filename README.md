Student Registration System
This project is a simple web application for student registration. It allows users to register new student profiles, view them in a dynamic list and a table, and perform basic management tasks.

Features
Student Registration: A form to collect student information including name, email, program, year, interests, and an optional photo URL.

Local Storage: All registered student data is saved locally in the browser's localStorage and persists even after the page is closed.

Dynamic Display: Student profiles are displayed in both a responsive card view and a summary table, which update in real time.

Search and Filter: A search bar allows users to filter the displayed profiles instantly.

Edit and Delete: Users can edit existing profiles or delete them from the system.

Form Validation: The form includes validation for required fields, email format, and checks for duplicate entries.

Notes
This project was developed as a submission for a university lab assignment. The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on form handling, DOM manipulation, and data persistence using localStorage.
